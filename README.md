* This repository contains the code used for conducting the study, which applies CNN-LSTM model using CAMELS dataset in the US.

* The code was originally hosted on our Google Drive and was executed in the Google Colab environment, along with the folders that contains data and the output.

* The folders for the data and the models and the outputs were too big to be shared in GitHub, we provided them in the following link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D7GBtyxtJNPfC7Twfk6_DSSXzyZDG99s?usp=drive_link

* Here we provide the notebook which was used to conduct the study and create all the visualizations

* To reproduce the results, download the notebook and the folders and fix the new folders path (in the 1st cell in the notebook) to remove the google drive refernces
